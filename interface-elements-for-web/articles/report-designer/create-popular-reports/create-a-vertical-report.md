# Create a Vertical Report

1. [Create a new report](../add-new-reports.md) or [open an existing one](../open-reports.md).

2. [Bind the report](../bind-to-data.md) to a required data source.

3. Change the report page layout to landscape so that the vertical table fit the report. Switch to the [Properties](../../report-designer-tools/ui-panels/properties-panel.md) panel, expand the **Page Settings** category and enable the **Landscape** property.

4. Replace the Detail band with the  [Vertical Header, Vertical Detail and Vertical Total](../introduction-to-banded-reports.md#vertical-bands) bands to display record fields vertically. Expand the **Actions** category and click the following items to add vertical bands to your report:


    | Icon | Description |
    |---|---|
    | ![](../../../images/eurd-web-vertical-reports-add-vertical-header.png) | The **Vertical Header band** contains a table with a single column that displays headers of the report's data fields. |
    | ![](../../../images/eurd-web-vertical-reports-add-vertical-detail.png) | The **Vertical Details band** contains a table with a single column that is printed so many times as there are records in the report's data source. |
    | ![](../../../images/eurd-web-vertical-reports-add-vertical-total.png) | The **Vertical Total band** contains a table with a single column that has so many labels in cells as there are summary functions you specified for each field in the Report Wizard (only the sum function for each field in this demo). |

# First Look at the Report Designer

![](../../../images/eurd-win-report-designer.png)

The _design surface_ displays a report's structure and contents. You can use the tools on the Report Designer's panels to design the report:

- use the [Menu](report-designer-tools\menu.md) to set up your report;

- drop report controls from the [Toolbox](report-designer-tools\toolbox.md) to the design surface;

-  access report editing commands in the [Main Toolbar](report-designer-tools\toolbar.md);

- use the [Properties](report-designer-tools\ui-panels\properties-panel.md) panel to set up the report controls;

- use the [Expressions](report-designer-tools\ui-panels\expressions-panel.md) panel to specify criteria for formatting data, creating calculated fields and conditionally shaping data;

- access the report's data source schema in the [Field List](report-designer-tools\ui-panels\field-list.md) panel;

- access the report's elements in the [Report Explorer](report-designer-tools\ui-panels\report-explorer.md) panel;

A blank report's design surface displays page margins and an empty [detail band](introduction-to-banded-reports.md).

Use view commands of the [Main Toolbar](report-designer-tools\toolbar.md) to change the Report Designer's default zoom factor.

Click **Preview** to open a [Print Preview](preview-print-and-export-reports.md) and display the generated report document with the data source's data.
